# Russian (phonetic Mac) keyboard
Add a keyboard using XKB that matches the Mac/OS X phonetic Russian keyboard.

See [here](https://github.com/ahnolds/Russian-phonetic-chrome-extension) for
a Chrome extension based on this package to add this keyboard to Chrome OS.

Note: the XKB files are those from Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS. Your mileage may vary
(i.e. the `setup.sh` script will tell you it can't install the new versions if
your original versions don't match these reference copies).
